      <h1> Add a user to database </h1>
      <h2> Select some values for the new student to be entered in the database or just leave them as they are  and click Test the API</h2>
      <h2> Don't get too attached as the record will be deleted at the end of the test :-) </h2>
      <h3> After clicking, a student will be added to the database, all records will be listed, our record will be found and updated with new, interesting values, and finally deleted </h3>
      <h3> of course you can only see this in the console, so fire up your dev tools!</h3>
